  <h2>How to Use These Papers Effectively</h2>

  <p>
  Instead of just reading the paper, try solving it in a timed environment. 
  Simulate actual exam conditions and attempt questions honestly. 
  After solving, compare answers with your notes and revise weak topics.
  </p>

  <p>
  Regular practice with previous year question papers significantly increases performance 
  and reduces exam stress.
